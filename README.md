# LocalizationInCAU

Localization with image on campus of CAU

We collected data by taking pictures ourselves and augmented the data by implementing our own transform functions for data augmentation, without using any libraries. We then trained the data on the Resnet model and created a GUI program in Python.

Data_Augmentation folder:
This folder contains the transform functions necessary for data augmentation and Python files that apply these functions to images to augment the data.

Model_App folder:
This folder is composed of the code for training the model and the final result of the project, the GUI program file.
