### How to train a model

1. Split data you want to train with into train, valid and test set, and save them in the 'data' folder.

2. Run the 'train.py' file. When the training is finished, the best model is saved as 'best_model.pt' in 'output' folder.


### How to execute the final program

1. Run the 'main.py' file. It may take 5~7 seconds to load the pre-trained model.

2. Click the 'Open File' button and select a picture of a building on campus.

3. Click the 'Where am I?' button to find your current location on the campus map.
